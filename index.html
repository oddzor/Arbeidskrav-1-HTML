              I'm a 32-year-old man(child) from Sætre - famously known as the
              center of the universe.<br /><br />

              I went to high school in Røyken studying media and communications.
              During this time I also started working at Specsavers<br />
              which would become a part of my life for years to come.
              <br /><br />After high school, I decided to take on an entirely
              different adventure.I enlisted in the military at GSV, where I
              dedicated a year to protecting <br />Norway's northern frontier,
              at the Russian border.<br />
              <br />After my military service, I set my sights on the skies and
              traveled all the way to Florida, USA, to pursue a career in
              aviation. <br />At Phoenix East Aviation, I not only earned my
              commercial pilot's license but also had the privilege of sharing
              my <br />knowledge and expertise as an instructor.<br /><br />
              4 years later, returning to Norway, I continued my journey in
              aviation while converting my certification to european standards
              at<br />
              OSM Aviation Academy. It was a period of growth and learning,
              which eventually led me to a new chapter in my career.<br /><br />
              After a few years at Specsavers to stay financially afloat I was
              hired at Pilot Flight Academy as a flight instructor, <br />
              then I was sent down to Airwin Academy in Hungary to reinstate my
              instructor licenses.
              <br />After this I continued my journey, very much enjoying it. It
              is at times stressful, dangerous and exhausting but also
              <br />very rewarding to be given such responsibility to not only
              teach, but to keep both myself, the student and <br />the (costly)
              hardware safe in the some times extreme weather in Norway.

              <br /><br />In 2023, I was relieved of my position at Pilot Flight
              Academy and had (for some time) been considering a career change
              and getting<br />
              my feet wet in the world of technology. My interest in tech,
              combined with my desire to constantly push my boundaries,<br />
              led me to enroll as a student in the Frontend Developer course at
              <b><mark>Gokstad Akademiet</mark></b
              >.<br /><br />
              I'm set to complete this program by the summer of 2025, and I
              couldn't be more excited about the future possibilities it holds.
              <br />Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an adrenaline junkie at
              heart. I find immense joy in gaming, lifting weights,
              skateboarding, <br />and partaking in various adrenaline-pumping
              sports. <br /><br />When I'm not pushing my limits, I enjoy
              relaxing with movies and series, staying updated on the latest
              tech trends, <br />and reconnecting with the beauty of nature.
              Life is an adventure, and I'm on a constant quest to explore new
              horizons, <br />both professionally and personally. Whether it's
              soaring through the skies or writing code for the future,
              <br />I'm always ready to embrace the next exciting challenge life
              has in store for me.<br /><br /><i
